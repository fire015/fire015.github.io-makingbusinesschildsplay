					<h2>Chapter 6: Negotiating like children</h2>
					<p>There are undoubtedly negotiation skills that come naturally to a child that we as adults have lost. Even those of us who have been on negotiation training courses can struggle to replicate these skills as effectively.  Chapter six looks at how children use enthusiasm, what if questions, creativity, high initial demands, patience and even throwing tantrums as effective negotiation techniques that we could all utilise.</p>

					<h2>Chapter 7: Influencing and persuading</h2>
					<p>As well as being very good negotiators, children are have a knack for influencing and persuading.  They find common ground, forgive and forget, are positive and enthusiastic and naturally use non-verbal communication.  Whilst these are skills we can all use, as parents we constantly influence our children through making them part of the decision making process, using headlines and telling stories.  Chapter seven looks at how we can transfer these behaviours to the workplace.</p>

					<h2>Chapter 8: Dealing with fear and change </h2>
					<p>Young children seem to have very little fear and are much more accepting of change than adults. Yet as they get older they become more afraid, perhaps because as parents we try to use fear to control our children.  Chapter eight looks at the natural ways in which parents behave to help our children cope with their fears and how we ourselves could exhibit them more at work.</p>

					<h2>Chapter 9: Listening is caring</h2>
					<p>With our children, we have an extremely strong and deep bond, but this is rarely replicated at work.  One of the reasons for this is that we understand what they want and need (most of the time) because we actually listen and really hear what they say.  Chapter nine looks at how much better things could be at work if we listened to and cared about our colleagues.</p>

					<h2>Chapter 10: Who is really in charge?</h2>
					<p>As an adult, I like to believe that I am the one in control of my destiny, my wife, my children, my staff, my life! But I think much of the time I am not actually in charge of anything. At work I am told what to do by my boss and upwardly managed by my team. At home I am told what to do by my wife and my children.  Chapter ten looks at the similarities between techniques to discipline and control at home and at work and how these can be utilised to make us more effective in both environments.</p>
